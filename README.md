# Events and Debugging Assessment

Time to assess how well you have learned to use the debugging tools in Chrome Dev Tools, and writing click event listeners. This application is to show kids with illnesses and the memories the would like to make. Celebrities sign up to help kids make memories.

> ðŸ§¨ Make sure you answer the vocabulary and understanding questions at the end of this document before notifying your coaches that you are done with the project

## Event Listeners to Create

1. When the kid name is clicked, it should display their wish.
1. When the celebrity name is clicked, it should display their sport.
1. The pairings list should should contain the pairing in the following format.
    ```html
    {child name} will be making memories with {celebrity name}, a {celebrity sport} star, by {child wish}
    ```

Below is an animation showing how the application should look when complete and how the event listeners should work.

## Setup

Your instruction team will provide a link for you to create your assessment repository. Once your repo is created, clone it to your machine.

1. Make sure you are in your `workspace` directory.
1. `git clone {github repo SSH string}`.
1. `cd` into the directory it creates.
1. `code .` to open the project code.
1. Use the `serve` command to start the web server.
1. Open the URL provided in Chrome.

Make sure your Developer Tools are open at all times while working on this project. Use the messages provided in the Console to determine what code needs to be fixed or implemented, and use breakpoints in the Sources tab to step through your code as you debug.

## Vocabulary and Understanding

Before you click the "Complete Assessment" button on the Learning Platform, add your answers below each question and make a commit.

1. When a child is clicked on in the browser, which module contains the code that will execute on that event happening? Can you explain the algorithm of that logic?
   > Your answer here.  The Kids.js module contains the code that will be exrcuted. 
   Logic
   The event listener looks at the entire document and it is looking for the data-type in this instance it's "child". Next if the data is correct then it grabs the child's name and wish, which will be displayed in the window alert.
2. In the **Pairings** module, why must the `findCelebrityMatch()` function be invoked inside the `for..of` loop that iterates the kids array?
   > Your answer here. The findCelebrityMatch() function must be placed in the loop because each child needs to be matched with their celebrity.
3. In the **CelebrityList** module, can you describe how the name of the sport that the celebrity plays can be displayed in the window alert text?
   > Your answer here. The sport name is stored in the HTML as data-sport when the list is created, then retrieved from that same attribute when clicked.
4. Can you describe, in detail, the algorithm that is in the `main` module?
   > Your answer here. 
   Step one it is Importing all the dependencies for main such as (import {Celebrities} from "./CelebritiyList.js").
   Step two we are getting the dom container (document.querySelector("#container")).
   Step three for this step all we are doing is building the html structure for example (<article class="assignments">
        <h2>Pairings</h2>
        ${Pairings()}
    </article>)
    Step four we are simply rendering the dom for example (addKidsEventListener(), addCelebritiesEventListener())
